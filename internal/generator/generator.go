Generator initializes the dataChan channel, then calls the Sensor and Process goroutines.
- Sensor runs independently, generates random values, SensorData, and sends it through dataChan.
  - Sensor also receives Command messages via inCommandChan to modify its behavior in real time.
- Process receives SensorData, calculates statistics, builds a Result, and sends it through outResultChan.
